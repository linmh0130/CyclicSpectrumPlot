# CyclicSpectrumPlot
The MATLAB function, CycSpecFft, is used to get the cyclic spectrum of an input signal sequence.

The usage can be found by following MATLAB code:
```
help CycSpecFft
```

BPSK_Demo.m plots the cyclic spectrum of a phase of random BPSK signal.

BPSK_Demo2.m plots the statistical cyclic spectrum of random BPSK signals.
